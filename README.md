THIS IS A WIP

IdleMiner is a simple game that has the player contruct and upgrade mines. 
Different raw resources are colleted from these mines that the player can choose to refine.
The refined resources can be crafted in to more advanced items.

The goal is to unlock all mines and facilities, which all get progressively more expensive. 
The player is meant to let the game run itself for the most part. 
The player decides when to purchase new mines and facilities, which raw resources to refine, and which items to craft. 

~~Right now you're only able to purchase the copper mine, but very soon you'll be able to do much more!~~

In the latest version you can unlock both copper and tin mine (the latter does not currently have an image attached when unlocked), unlock all furnaces, and select any recipe. 
With Copper and Tin available you can make copper bars, tin bars and bronze bars!

much more to come in later updates
