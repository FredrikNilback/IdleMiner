THIS IS A WIP

IdleMiner is a simple game that has the player contruct and upgrade mines. 
Different raw resources are colleted from these mines that the player can choose to refine.
The refined resources can be crafted in to more advanced items.

The goal is to unlock all mines and facilities, which all get progressively more expensive. 
The player is meant to let the game run itself for the most part. 
The player decides when to purchase new mines and facilities, which raw resources to refine, and which items to craft. 

Right now you're only able to purchase the copper mine, but very soon you'll be able to do much more!
